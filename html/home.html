            <h3> Ethiopians </h3>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopians">Ethiopians</a> are the native inhabitants of Ethiopia, 
            as well as the global diaspora of Ethiopia. 
            Ethiopians constitute several component ethnic groups,
            many of which are closely related to ethnic groups
            in neighboring Eritrea and other parts of the Horn of Africa. </p>
            <h3> Oromo </h3>
        <p> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oromo_people"> Oromo </a>are a Cushitic ethnic group native to the Oromia 
            region of Ethiopia and parts of Northern Kenya. They speak the 
            Oromo language (also called Afaan Oromoo), which is part of 
            the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family.
            They are one of the largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
            According to the last Ethiopian census of 2007,
            the Oromo numbered 25,488,344 people or 
            34.5% of the Ethiopian population</p>
